                            <h6>What & Why</h6>
                            <p>The Goods and Services Tax Identification Number (GSTIN) is a mandatory registration for
                                businesses in India. It is used to collect taxes, claim input tax credit (ITC), and file
                                GST returns, unifying several indirect taxes into a single system.</p>

                            <h6>Who Needs to Register?</h6>
                            <p>Registration is mandatory for businesses whose annual turnover exceeds the threshold
                                limit (e.g., ₹40 lakh for goods, ₹20 lakh for services). It is also required for
                                e-commerce operators, businesses making inter-state sales, and others as specified by
                                the GST law.</p>

                            <h6>General Documents Required</h6>
                            <p><strong>Identity & Address:</strong> PAN and Aadhaar card of the
                                proprietor/directors.<br>
                                <strong>Business Proof:</strong> Certificate of Incorporation or Partnership Deed.<br>
                                <strong>Location Proof:</strong> Electricity bill or rental agreement for the place of
                                business.<br>
                                <strong>Bank Details:</strong> A cancelled cheque or bank statement.
                            </p>

                            <h6>How to Apply for GSTIN Online</h6>
                            <p><strong>1. Visit GST Portal:</strong> Go to the official GST website (gst.gov.in).<br>
                                <strong>2. Get TRN:</strong> Start a new registration by providing PAN, email, and
                                mobile to generate a Temporary Reference Number (TRN).<br>
                                <strong>3. Fill Application:</strong> Use the TRN to log in, fill out the detailed
                                application form, and upload scanned copies of the required documents.<br>
                                <strong>4. Submit & Verify:</strong> Submit the application using a Digital Signature
                                Certificate (DSC) or E-Signature (Aadhaar OTP).<br>
                                <strong>5. Get ARN:</strong> An Application Reference Number (ARN) is generated for
                                tracking. The GSTIN and certificate are typically issued within 3-7 working days after
                                successful verification.

                            <p>ITR is a declaration of income earned during a financial year. Filing is mandatory if
                                your income exceeds the basic exemption limit. It is also essential for claiming tax
                                refunds, applying for loans, and for visa processing.</p>

                                - [cite_start]Income up to ₹12 lakhs has been made zero-tax because of an increased

                                - [cite_start]Taxpayers must opt out of the new regime during filing to use the old

                            <p>TDS is a system where the entity making a payment (like an employer paying a salary or a
                                bank paying interest) deducts a certain percentage as tax before giving the full amount
                                to the recipient. This amount is deposited directly with the government, ensuring a
                                steady tax collection and preventing evasion.</p>

                            <h6>How It Works</h6>
                            <p>The payer deducts the tax and provides the recipient with a TDS certificate (Form
                                16/16A). When you file your ITR, you can claim credit for this tax that has already been
                                paid on your behalf. If the TDS paid is more than your total tax liability, you receive
                                a refund.</p>

                            <h6>Common Payments Subject to TDS</h6>
                            <p>

                            </p>
