                            <h6>What & Why</h6>
                            <p>Issued by state governments, a Ration Card allows eligible households to purchase
                                essential food items like wheat, rice, and sugar at subsidized rates from Fair Price
                                Shops (FPS) under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). It also acts as a common proof
                                of address and identity.</p>

                            <h6>Types of Ration Cards</h6>
                            <p>Based on a household's economic status, cards are generally categorized as:<br>
                                <strong>AAY (Antyodaya Anna Yojana):</strong> For the poorest families, offering the
                                highest subsidy.<br>
                                <strong>PHH (Priority Household):</strong> For families meeting state eligibility
                                criteria, entitled to a fixed quantity of grains per member.<br>
                                <strong>APL (Above Poverty Line):</strong> For households with higher incomes, who may
                                receive items at less subsidized rates or not at all.
                            </p>

                            <h6>General Documents Required</h6>
                            <p>Application form, Aadhaar cards of all family members, proof of address (utility bill),
                                income certificate, and passport-sized photographs of the head of the family.</p>

                            <h6>Application Process</h6>
                            <p>Applications are managed by the Food, Civil Supplies & Consumer Affairs department of
                                each state. The process can typically be initiated online through the state's specific
                                food portal or offline at the local Circle/Taluk office.</p>

                            <h6>One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC)</h6>
                            <p>This scheme allows beneficiaries to access their entitled food grains from any Fair Price
                                Shop in the country, which is especially useful for migrant workers.</p>

                            <h6>What It Is</h6>
                            <p>In India, a "Pension Card" is most often the Pension Payment Order (PPO) number. This is
                                a unique 12-digit number given to each pensioner under the Employees' Pension Scheme
                                (EPS) by the EPFO, or a similar identifier for government pensioners.</p>

                            <h6>Why It's Important</h6>
                            <p>The PPO number is a crucial reference for all communication with the pension-sanctioning
                                authority. It is required to receive the monthly pension, transfer the pension account
                                between banks, and most importantly, for submitting the annual Life Certificate (Jeevan
                                Pramaan).</p>

                            <h6>Who Issues It</h6>
                            <p><strong>EPFO:</strong> For employees of the private sector covered under the EPS-95
                                scheme.<br>
                                <strong>Central/State Governments:</strong> For retired government employees.
                            </p>

                            <h6>How to Get Your PPO</h6>
                            <p>The PPO is generated by the concerned authority (like EPFO) after processing the pension
                                claim upon retirement. The number is communicated to the pensioner and the bank branch
                                where the pension is to be credited.</p>

                            <h6>Jeevan Pramaan (Life Certificate)</h6>
                            <p>Pensioners must submit a Life Certificate annually to continue receiving their pension.
                                This can be done digitally using the PPO number at various centres or through the Jeevan
                                Pramaan portal, proving that the pensioner is still alive.</p>

                            <h6>What & Why</h6>
                            <p>Life insurance is a contract with an insurer who, in exchange for regular premium
                                payments, provides a lump-sum payment (Sum Assured) to your beneficiaries upon your
                                death. It ensures your family can manage debts, meet goals, and maintain their
                                lifestyle.</p>

                            <h6>Common Policy Types</h6>
                            <p><strong>Term Insurance:</strong> Pure risk cover. Offers a large sum assured for a low
                                premium for a fixed term, with no maturity benefit.<br>
                                <strong>Endowment Plan:</strong> A combination of insurance and savings. Pays out on
                                death or on policy maturity.<br>
                                <strong>ULIP (Unit Linked Plan):</strong> Combines insurance with market-linked
                                investments.<br>
                                <strong>Money-Back Policy:</strong> Periodically pays out a portion of the sum assured
                                during the policy term.
                            </p>

                            <h6>Key Factors to Consider</h6>
                            <p><strong>Cover Amount (Sum Assured):</strong> Should be at least 10-15 times your annual
                                income.<br>
                                <strong>Policy Term:</strong> Should cover you at least until your retirement age.<br>
                                <strong>Claim Settlement Ratio (CSR):</strong> A high CSR (above 95%) indicates the
                                insurer's reliability in paying claims.<br>
                                <strong>Riders:</strong> Optional add-ons like critical illness or accidental death
                                benefits for enhanced protection.
                            </p>

                            <h6>Tax Benefits (Income Tax Act, 1961)</h6>
                            <p>Premiums paid are typically eligible for deduction under Section 80C. The death/maturity
                                benefit is usually tax-free under Section 10(10D), subject to conditions.</p>
