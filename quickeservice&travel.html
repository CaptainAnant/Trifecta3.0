                                <strong>Zero Commission:</strong> Drivers receive 100% of the fare. The app does not
                                charge any commission, leading to better earnings for drivers.<br>
                                <strong>Direct Payment:</strong> You pay the fare directly to the driver via UPI or cash
                                at the end of the trip.<br>

                            <p>The app shows you the estimated fare based on the official meter charges for your city.
                                Since there's no commission, the fare is often more affordable compared to aggregator
                                platforms. The full amount you pay goes directly into the driver's account.</p>
