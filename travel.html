                            <p>Namma Yatri is a community-driven, ride-hailing application built on an open network
                                (ONDC). It started in Bengaluru and is designed to offer a fairer service by connecting
                                customers directly with auto-rickshaw and cab drivers, eliminating middlemen
                                commissions.</p>

                            <h6>Core Features</h6>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Zero Commission:</strong> Drivers receive 100% of the fare. The app does not
                                charge any commission, leading to better earnings for drivers.<br>
                                <strong>Direct Payment:</strong> You pay the fare directly to the driver via UPI or cash
                                at the end of the trip.<br>
                                <strong>Transparent Fares:</strong> The fare is based on government-approved rates, with
                                no hidden charges or random surge pricing.<br>
                                <strong>Open Network:</strong> Built on the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC),
                                promoting an open and decentralized digital economy.
                            </p>

                            <h6>How Pricing Works</h6>
                            <p>The app shows you the estimated fare based on the official meter charges for your city.
                                Since there's no commission, the fare is often more affordable compared to aggregator
                                platforms. The full amount you pay goes directly into the driver's account.</p>

                            <h6>Who is it for?</h6>
                            <p>Ideal for daily commuters and travelers in supported cities looking for a more
                                transparent, ethical, and often cost-effective way to hire auto-rickshaws and cabs.</p>
